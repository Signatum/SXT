title = Kerbolyov 'Tsar A' Large Fuel Tank
manufacturer = Kerbolyov Design Bureau
description = The largest tank ever built by the KDB, and the ultimate outcome of their 'Not One Step Smaller' design philosophy. Although this later turned out to be intended as a front to channel ever increasing funds towards the snack-related habits of the Bureau's board. However, the damage had already been done and vast warehouses have been left filled with rockets, rather than snacks. [SXT/Parts/SuperLaunchers/Hull/Tsar/5-to-7-25.cfg]
