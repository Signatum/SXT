description = Repeat after me tovarisch, 'This is not to make giant waffles; this is for rockets'. The grid fins is an array of small aerodynamic surfaces, arranged in a lattice, reducing the torque placed on the control mechanism at high-speeds and allowing for a more compact control system. They perform well at sub- and super-sonic speeds, but poorly at the tran-sonic region
