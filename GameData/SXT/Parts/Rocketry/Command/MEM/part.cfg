PART
{
// this is a sample config file, for determining a good file format for defining part parameters
// comment line - ignored by cfg parser
// empty lines, or lines without a '=' sign are also ignored
// all other lines are split at the '=' sign, and the left operand is used to know what parameter we are setting
// diferent parameters require data in different formats (see docs), and each module has it's own parameters (again, see docs)
// each assignment must be in a single line. Lines without assignments will be ignored. (You CAN turn on word wrap, though)
// each keyword here relates to an existing variable in the assigned module. If the keyword isn't found, it is ignored.
// conversely, if a keyword is left unassigned (as in not in the file), it will be initialized with it's default value
// This is done automatically, so any public variable defined in the loaded module can be accessed this way (provided it's value can be parsed)

title = Munar Excursion Module Ascent Stage
manufacturer = Kerlington Model Rockets and Paper Products Inc
description = The Ascent stage houses the crew cabin with instrument panels and flight controls. It contains it's own Ascent Propulsion System (APS) engine and propellant tanks for return to munar orbit and rendezvous with the Command/Service Module. It also contains a Reaction Control System (RCS) for attitude and translation control. A forward EVA hatch provides access to and from the munar surface, while an overhead docking port provides access to and from the Command Module.
