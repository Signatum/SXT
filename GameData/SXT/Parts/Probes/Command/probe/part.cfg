title = JKSS Probe Core
manufacturer = Probodobodyne Inc
description = Studies conducted by Probodobodyne Inc have found that today's youth consider mono-propellent engines to be quote 'totally main-stream, uncool, and Grandpa Bill always talks about how Mono-propellent engines saved his butt in the first Mun landing, ugh what is with all of these questions?!'. Upon being bribed for further information, the participants revealed that Xenon powered Ion engines were the current trending item. So in an effort to reach out to the youth and more importantly increase sales, the JKSS has had a tank of xenon crammed inside of it. Solar panels and ion engine sold separately.
