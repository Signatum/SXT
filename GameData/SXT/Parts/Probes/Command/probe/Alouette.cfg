description = The QUBC is the first and final project of the Synergistic Integration Sub-Committee of Probodobodyne Inc. While lacking SAS and reaction wheels, it does feature integrated solar panels and antenna systems. The SISC was shutdown after key figures were found to by 'Synergising' company funds with their personal expense accounts.
