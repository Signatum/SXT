description = Developed in partnership with the Kerbodyne, the SC-XL10 project ran into no difficulties and proceeded entirely without incident. There was no fraud, no explosions and everything went fine. STEADLER would like to remind anyone that might say otherwise that STEADLER is currently working on an organic super-computer and is in need of 'spares'.
